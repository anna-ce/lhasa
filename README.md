# LHASA
Landslide Hazard Analysis for Situational Awareness

LHASA was created at Goddard Space Flight Center to identify the potential for landslides in nearly real time. The model is currently running, and it's output can be seen at https://pmm.nasa.gov/precip-apps. It can also be accessed as an ArcGIS web map at https://landslides.nasa.gov/viewer. For more detail about the model, please see the published article at http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017ef000715.

The R scripts here are written to be easily understood, executed, and modified by potential users of this research.

Full operational code is available in python at https://github.com/vightel/ojo-bot.
